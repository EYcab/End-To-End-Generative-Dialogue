PRESENTATION:

- overview of dataset, end to end dialogue system
- setting up a distributed system for training
- compare results for RNN, GRU, LSTM, LSTMs with Attention
- next steps with HRED, etc.
- demo of some sort with the chat system (talk about some of the shortcomings, simple utterances)

TODO:

- get beam working
- run each of the models for 10 epochs-ish? -> save the model, record results
- implement RNN model

- implement a way to demo the stuff using chat interface, demo can be done using terminal
- modify preprocess.py in seq2seq-elements to make the data directory if doesnt exist
- experiment with HRED model


- add subTle dataset stuff
- heirarchical model 
- add in error rate stuff
