I've included the script to download the Ubuntu dataset from the Github repo: https://github.com/rkadlec/ubuntu-ranking-dataset-creator.

Before running, make sure that nltk is installed in python. Afterwards, run this command in python to set up nltk datasets. 

import nltk
nltk.download()

To download the data and run preprocessing, run the script included with the below command.

./generate.sh -t -s -l

This should generate a train.csv, valid.csv, and test.csv. They are formatted as triples where the first string is the previous conversation, the second string is a reply, and the third string is a 1 or 0 flag representing whether or not this was a real reply.
