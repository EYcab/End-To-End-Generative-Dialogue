sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install luarocks

In order to set up your instance, you're going to need to install torch

git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive
cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;
./install.sh

cd .. 

You'll also need to install all relevant packages, so 

luarocks install rnn
luarocks install parallel


sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev hdf5-tools
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/torch-hdf5.git
cd torch-hdf5
luarocks make hdf5-0-0.rockspec

cd ..

You'll also need to install Anaconda
wget http://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh


git clone https://github.com/michaelfarrell76/Singularity.git
cd Singularity
mkdir data
cd data
mkdir MovieTriples

(Disconnect from shell, reconnect from shell if python/torch aren't loading properly)

Afterwards, you'll want to clone the repo and git pull. 

Next, you'll want to put the MovieTriples dataset into the correct director. First navigate into the MovieTriples
directory on your local drive, then run the below:
gcloud compute copy-files . train-conv2:~/stash/singularity/data/MovieTriples --zone us-east1-c

Next, run the command for preprocessing, and you should be good to go!

cd 
cd Singularity
cd seq2seq-elements
python preprocess.py

For figuring out IP adddressses between Google compute instances, you can use their instance name 
and the nslookup command. For example, if you were in another Google Compute instance and 
wanted to figure out the ip address for the instance model-1, you can run the command below command

nslookup model-1

This should return to you the local IP address of model-1 that you can use to connect with.
