In order to set up your instance, you're going to need to install torch

git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive
cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;
./install.sh

You'll also need to install all relevant packages, so 

luarocks install rnn
luarocks install hdf5

You'll also need to install Anaconda
wget http://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

(Disconnect from shell, reconnect from shell if python/torch aren't loading properly)

Afterwards, you'll want to clone the repo and git pull. 

Next, you'll want to put the MovieTriples dataset into the correct director. First navigate into the MovieTriples
directory on your local drive, then run the below:
gcloud compute copy-files . train-conv2:~/stash/singularity/data/MovieTriples --zone us-east1-c

Next, run the command for preprocessing, and you should be good to go!

For figuring out IP adddressses between Google compute instances, you can use their instance name 
and the nslookup command. For example, if you were in another Google Compute instance and 
wanted to figure out the ip address for the instance model-1, you can run the command below command

nslookup model-1

This should return to you the local IP address of model-1 that you can use to connect with.
